# LayoutSwitcher

A local, private macOS keyboard‑layout switcher for mixed **RU/EN** typing — a
native Swift menu‑bar agent that fixes text typed in the wrong layout, proactively
sets the right layout before you type, and never touches the network.

> Goal isn't "100% perfect auto‑detect" (impossible — the same keystrokes can be
> valid in both layouts). It's **zero corruption of already‑correct text** and
> **instant one‑key recovery**. When unsure, the app does nothing.

## Features

- **Auto‑convert** a word typed in the wrong layout (`ghbdtn ` → `привет `) using
  frequency dictionaries + a character‑trigram model. Converts only at a word
  boundary and only at high confidence — never mid‑word, never on doubt.
- **Proactive layout** before you type: per‑app / per‑field memory, latin for
  url / search / password fields.
- **One‑key correction loop**: fix the last word (`⌃⌥Z`), repeat to cycle back;
  double‑`⇧` switches layout manually; `⌃⌥X` undoes a conversion (no clash with `⌘Z`).
- **Mixed RU/EN safety**: exceptions list, "always latin" whitelist (API, sprint,
  PR…), and learning from your manual reverts.
- **Shadow‑mode** to calibrate the threshold without changing any text, plus a
  recent‑conversions review.
- **Text tools** on a selection: transliteration, case cycle, Caps‑Lock fix, snippets.
- **Reliable & private**: self‑healing event tap, fail‑open on any error, zero
  network, ephemeral keystroke buffer, password‑field stand‑down.

## Requirements

- macOS 13+ (Apple Silicon), Xcode / Swift 6 toolchain.

## Build & run

```bash
cd app
swift test                      # 66 unit tests (engine, mapping, buffer, store, text tools)

bash scripts/make_cert.sh       # ONCE: stable self‑signed identity so macOS
                                # permission grants survive rebuilds
bash scripts/build_app.sh       # → dist/LayoutSwitcher.app (+ headless self‑test)
open dist/LayoutSwitcher.app
```

On first launch grant **two** permissions, then quit & relaunch:

1. **Accessibility** (read focused field) — the app prompts.
2. **Input Monitoring** (the keyboard event tap) — System Settings → Privacy.
   Without it the tap is "active" but receives no events.

Optional crash/login auto‑restart: `bash scripts/install_launchagent.sh` (KeepAlive).

> Why `make_cert.sh`? Ad‑hoc signing changes the binary hash every build, so macOS
> treats each rebuild as a new app and drops the permission grants. A stable
> self‑signed identity fixes that. See [app/README.md](app/README.md).

## Hotkeys (rebindable in Settings → Хоткеи)

| Action | Default |
|---|---|
| Fix last word + switch layout | `⌃⌥Z` |
| Toggle auto‑convert | `⌃⌥A` |
| Undo conversion | `⌃⌥X` |
| Transliterate selection | `⌃⌥T` |
| Cycle case of selection | `⌃⌥C` |
| Fix Caps of selection | `⌃⌥U` |
| Convert current line | `⌃⌥L` |
| Switch layout | double `⇧` |

## How detection works

For each finished word the engine compares the typed form against the form in the
other layout:

1. **Dictionary** — typed form is a real word, the other isn't → leave it; the other
   is a real word, typed isn't → convert (high confidence).
2. **Valid in both layouts** → leave it (when in doubt, do nothing).
3. **Out of vocabulary** → a character‑trigram language model (built from the same
   word lists) decides, and only converts above a configurable confidence threshold.

Exceptions / whitelist / learned reverts short‑circuit everything above.

## Privacy

No network code anywhere (no telemetry, no update checks). The current‑word buffer
is ephemeral and wiped at every boundary; only your settings and lexicons are stored
locally under `~/Library/Application Support/LayoutSwitcher/`.

## Project layout

```
app/        SwiftPM package — SwitcherCore (pure, tested) + LayoutSwitcher (agent)
req/        Requirements, decomposition, acceptance scenarios
app/ACCEPTANCE.md   Per‑scenario acceptance results
```

## Status

Implements the full requirement set (FR/NFR/REL/SEC) and passes all release‑critical
acceptance scenarios — see [app/ACCEPTANCE.md](app/ACCEPTANCE.md). Known limitations
(documented there): url/email field detection is limited by what Accessibility
exposes; web password fields lack a secure‑field role; display‑capture games may not
report fullscreen.
